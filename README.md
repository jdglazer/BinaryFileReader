# BinaryFileReader
This is a simple php script designed to read values out of binary files as either shorts, integers, longs, floats, or doubles. It automatically detects the machine "endianness" so you do not have to worry about this and allows the user to set the endianness of the read.

Improvements Needed
-------------------
- Add comments (i will do this!)
- Write functions to read strings of characters out of a file
- Test in older versions than php 5 and make changes to ensure backward compatibility

Future Ideas
